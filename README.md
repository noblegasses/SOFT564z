Summary
-------

The goal of this project is to produce a tele-operated robot with some form of
obstacle detection using an ultrasonic sensor, that can read the level of water
sources. This has potential in agricultural, especially hydroponic, robotics as
a mobile water level monitor. This system will perform data sampling and motor
control via an arduino mega. The arduino will communicate via the I2C protocol
with an ESP32, which will in turn handle communication via Socket level TCP
programming with a PC with a tele-operation and data display program with a
custom TCP API back-end. This will allow the end user to control the robot via
the WASD keys, as well as begin a water level sample.
